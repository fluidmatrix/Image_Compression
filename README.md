This repository features the final course's first module in the course by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. The Code uses K Means Algorithm to downgrade the color depth from 26 Bits to 16 Bits. I have used a png file, where the compression algorithm flattens the image into matrices, so that it could be properly executed.
You can also use your own image. If the image is in any format except JPG, then there is a commmented code under Show Image, which transforms the image so that it could be processed adequately.
